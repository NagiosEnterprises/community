# Nagios Coding Style

## About these Documents

These documents hope to describe the preferred styling to be used when contributing to
projects in the Nagios community. Over the years, many people have contributed - each
bringing their own styles and naming conventions.

The goal is **to get there**. It doesn't make sense to update very large files all
in one batch with styling changes, as that removes a layer of transparency from
the end users. As existing bugs are fixed, or enhancements are being developed,
the area of code being changed will tend to be brought up to date with the style
set forth in these documents. This way it happens in small steps, and there aren't
any needlessly confusing 10,000+ line-changing patches being committed.

## TL;DR

If you just glance over this document - the main take away is to make your
code readable. Readable code is maintainable. *Maintainable code is sustainable.*
